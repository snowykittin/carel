<h1>NEAT Program:</h1>
        Our NEAT Program

        N = Network........with public high school students to identify high achieving
        under privileged students with college ambitions who are interested in building up
        their personal resumes by participating in the CAI college “prep” program. These
        identified students are also candidates for leadership roles in a Community

        the amount of individual financial aid awards from admitting colleges.
        E = Educate.............public high school students and community audiences
        about the college admissions and financial aid processes. These educational
        presentations are rendered online, in classrooms, and Town Hall type public
        meetings. This education provides guidance, hope, encouragement and
        enthusiasm to participating students

        admissions as well as college financial aid
